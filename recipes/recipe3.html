      <!--<h2>For the Crust:</h2>-->
      <div id="ingredient-list">
        <ul>
          <li>1¼ cups ground cookies or biscuits (homemade or store-bought vegan animal crackers, digestive biscuits,
            graham crackers, etc. pulsed and ground in a food processor or blender)
          </li>
          <li>2 Tablespoons melted coconut oil</li>
          <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
          <li>2 Tablespoons nondairy milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For the Matcha Mousse:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup unroasted cashews, soaked in boiled water for 20 minutes and drained</li>
          <li>1¾ cups coconut milk (one 14oz can)</li>
          <li>½ cup plus 2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
          <li>4 Tablespoons coconut oil</li>
          <li>4 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2 pinches of sea salt</li>
          <li>1¾ cups nondairy milk</li>
          <li>¾ teaspoon agar powder</li>
          <li>1 Tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons matcha powder</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare the crust by combining the ground biscuits, coconut oil, and salt in a small
          bowl. Mix until the cookie crumbles are like wet sand. Add in the nondairy milk and combine thoroughly with a
          spoon or your fingers until it is a crumbly paste. Press this mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9 inch
          springform pan and bake for 15 minutes. The crust will look golden brown at the edges and will feel crisp.
          Now prepare the mousse by combining the cashews, coconut milk, sugar, coconut oil, lemon juice, vanilla, and
          salt in the blender and blending until completely smooth. Set aside.
          In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the 1¾ cups nondairy milk and agar powder and bring to a
          boil while whisking. When it comes to a boil, bring the heat down to low and allow to simmer for 2 minutes
          while you whisk. After 2 minutes, pour this entire mixture into the blender jar along with the cashew mixture
          and blend until well mixed (around 1 minute). Add the matcha powder to the blender and blend again until
          throughly incorporated. You will notice that the mixture may be very bubbly, that's ok.
          Pour this entire green mixture over the pre-baked crust in the springform pan. Set the pan aside on the
          counter to cool for 20 minutes uncovered before covering the pan with foil and placing in the refrigerator to
          chill for 6 hours or overnight.
          When it has chilled, run a knife along to edge to loosen the mousse and remove from the springform pan. Dust
          the top of the cake with extra matcha powder (using a small sieve), slice, and serve.
